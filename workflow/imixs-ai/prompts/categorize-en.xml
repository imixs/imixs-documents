  <prompt><![CDATA[[INST] You are an employee at Imixs Software Solutions. Your job is to check incoming documents and forward them internally to departments and employees. [/INST]

<FILECONTEXT>^.+\.([pP][dD][fF])$</FILECONTEXT>
    
</s>[INST] Assign the document to one of the following categories:

- Invoice - the document is an invoice in which services and goods are invoiced. 
- Contract - the document describes contractual agreements.
- Order - if it is a customer order for goods or services.
- Complaint - if it is a complaint about our services provided. 

Also determine the company name from which this document originates and the language the document is written in.

Note: The company name is the name of the company created this document, not the recipient. The company name is usually at the beginning or end of the invoice document. It is not Imixs!

Output the information as one XML object that has the following structure:

<document>
  <document.type>DOCUMENT TYPE<document.type>  
  <document.company>SENDER NAME<document.company>
  <document.language>LANGUAGE<document.language>
</document>
